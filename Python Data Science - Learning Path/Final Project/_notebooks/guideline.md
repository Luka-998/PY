Next Steps:
🧹 1. Outlier Detection and Handling

    Use boxplots or z-score/IQR methods.

    Especially check for outliers in PRICE and highly influential features (e.g., RM, LSTAT, TAX, etc.)

📏 2. Feature Scaling

    Use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler — important for Ridge Regression.

    Store scalers for later use in evaluation/prediction.

🧠 3. Train-Test Split

    Use train_test_split (e.g., 80/20 or 70/30).

    Optionally, do stratified sampling if price bins are defined.

📐 4. Multicollinearity Check (before Ridge)

    Use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity.

    Ridge handles it well, but still good to be aware.

🧪 5. Baseline Linear Regression

    Train OLS Linear Regression.

    Check coefficients, residuals, R², MSE, MAE.

🔁 6. Residual Analysis

    Plot predicted vs. residuals.

    Histogram of residuals (check normality).

    Q-Q plot (optional but insightful).

🧱 7. Ridge Regression

    Apply Ridge with different alpha values (use GridSearchCV or manual loop).

    Compare performance with baseline.

📊 Optional but Valuable:

    Cross-validation (KFold, cross_val_score)

    Polynomial Features (to test non-linear relationships)

    Feature Importance/Selection (Lasso, permutation importance)

    Model interpretation (e.g., SHAP values or simple coefficient explanations)

🏁 Final Goal:

    Compare models (OLS vs. Ridge)

    Report on:

        MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²

        Best features

        Overfitting/underfitting patterns
