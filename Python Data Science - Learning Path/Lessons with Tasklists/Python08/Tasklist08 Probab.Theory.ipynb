    "**10.** As [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alegzndr/) explained in Session08, we consider finite, countably infinite, and uncountably infinite event sets in Probability Theory. The set of all natural numbers, $\\mathbb{N}$, is countably infinite, and its cardinal number - meaning its size - is $\\aleph_0$ (aleph-zero). A set is uncountably infinite if it cannot be brought into a 1:1 correspondence with the set of natural numbers, $\\mathbb{N}$, and of course $\\mathbb{R}$ - the set of real numbers - is thus uncountably infinite. We say that the cardinal number of $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\aleph_1$ (aleph-one). Prove that there are no sets whose cardinality lies between $\\aleph_0$ and $\\aleph_1$. Please make sure to keep the proof concise, elegant, and easy to read. You can use OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to solve this task if you prefer.\n",
