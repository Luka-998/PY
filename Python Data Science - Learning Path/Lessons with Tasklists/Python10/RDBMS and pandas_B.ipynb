    "## Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational database is a way of organizing (designing) data into tables where each table is in some way related to the other(s). This is where the 'relational' part is comming from. Plain and simple! \n",
    "\n",
    "But what is a database? In general, a database is a way of organizing the data. Relational database is just one of many types of databases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Database management system is a software that provides service for storing, updating, and retrieving the data from the database. Additionally, it provides many functionalities that make your life as user, a pleasant experience. There are functionalities that are particularly exposed to the special type of users called **DBA** (*Database Administrator*). These special functionalities are mostly non of the concern for regular users who want to perform **CRUD** (*Create, Read, Update, Delete*) operations. Yet, for any serious use of databases, you need an administrator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are many types of databases, when we talk about relational ones, we talk about RDBMS (*Relational Database Management System*). **MariaDB** is one of these. Some others that you may have heard are *Oracle*, *Postgres*, *Microsoft Access*, *MySQL*, *SQLite*, *MongoDB*, *ElasticSearch*, etc. Some are relational, some are non-relational. Which one you are going to use reallly boils down to the business requirements and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational approach to designing databases was invented in 1970s, but **Edgar Frank \"Ted\" Codd**. Previously used hierarchical and network databases had cons outweighting the pros in regard to modern times and modern use cases. This is where relational databases came and excelled. Along with the relational database design came a need to standardize a way of dealing with data in database system. This is when **SEQUEL** (*Structured English Query Language*) language was invented. However, it was shortly renamed to **SQL** (*Structured Query Language*). This is what we will be using later. Anyway, because SQL was so popular it became a synonum for relational databases. So much that non-relational databases are also called **NoSQL** databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we will be using **MariaDB** as RDBMS, and **SQL** to query data from the database and tables you hopefully have created by now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are going to introduce a new language and a ways of querying and processing the data, we have decided to use alredy known NYC Flights data set. You are already familiar with it, so we can solely focus on learning new concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright then, let's start.\n"

    "\n",
    "This SQL query selects data from two tables, weather and flights, and combines them using a LEFT JOIN. The goal is to gather information about United Airlines (carrier code 'UA') flights from certain airports to specific destinations during certain months.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `SELECT weather.*, flights.carrier, flights.origin AS ORG, MAX(distance) AS dist, SUM(dep_time), AVG(air_time)`: This line specifies the columns that should be returned in the query result. The `weather.*` selects all columns from the `weather` table, and then additional columns are selected from the `flights` table. The `MAX(distance)` function selects the maximum value of the distance column, `SUM(dep_time)` calculates the sum of dep_time column, and `AVG(air_time)` calculates the average of `air_time` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FROM flights AS f LEFT JOIN airlines as a ON f.carrier = a.carrier`: This line specifies the tables being queried and how they should be joined. The `flights` table is aliased as `f`, and then a `LEFT JOIN` is performed to the `airlines` table, which is aliased as `a`. The `ON` clause specifies that the join should be made where the `carrier` column in the `flights` table matches the `carrier` column in the `airlines` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `WHERE f.carrier = 'UA' AND f.dest IN ('IAH', 'MIA', 'FLL') AND f.origin != 'EWR' AND f.month BETWEEN 5 AND 10`: This line filters the data being queried. The `WHERE` clause specifies that the `carrier` column in the `flights` table must be `'UA'`, the `dest` column must be one of the three airport codes specified, the `origin` column cannot be `'EWR'`, and the `month` column must be between May and October (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GROUP BY f.year, f.month`: This line groups the query results by the `year` and `month` columns of the `flights` table. This means that the resulting data will be grouped by the `year` and `month` of each flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ORDER BY dist`: This line orders the query result by the `dist` column (the maximum distance of each group) in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this query returns a result set that contains weather information and aggregated data about United Airlines flights departing from certain airports to specific destinations during certain months. The result set is grouped by year and month, and the data is ordered by the maximum distance of each group.\n",

    "What is the SQL HAVING Clause?\n",
    "The HAVING clause is used to filter the result of the GROUP BY statement based on the specified conditions. It allows filtering grouped data using Boolean conditions (AND, OR). It was introduced because the WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregate functions. Similar to WHERE clause, it helps apply conditions but specifically works with grouped data. When we need to filter aggregated results, the HAVING clause is the appropriate choice.\n",
