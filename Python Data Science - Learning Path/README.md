##  **Repository Structure**
The repository is organized into lessons and corresponding datasets for each topic:
- **Lessons with Tasklist**: Learning lessons and after that tasklist which I complete point to point.
- **Supplementary**: Here I put some materials I am learning from apart from the Learnnig Path itself.
- **My Exercises**: Here I update my own exercises, practice and datasets I tried to analyise. 

 **Libraries used**:
  - Data Manipulation: pandas, NumPy
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: sklearn
  - Statistics: scipy
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
