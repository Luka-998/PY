# Data Science Learning Path - DataKolektiv

Welcome to my **Data Science Learning Path** repository! This project is part of my journey to master data science concepts, improve my Python programming skills, and build a solid foundation for future applications in **bioinformatics** and **data analysis**.

---

## **Goals of This Repository**
This repository is a structured collection of lessons, exercises, and projects designed to:
- **Enhance Python Skills**: Learn Python techniques for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
- **Master Data Science Concepts**: Apply tools like pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and machine learning libraries.
- **Prepare for Bioinformatics**: Build the coding and analytical skills needed for __bioinformatics__, where I aim to combine biological data with computational techniques.
- **Document My Learning Journey**: Share my progress and understanding through well-documented exercises and projects.

## ðŸ“‚ **Repository Structure**
The repository is organized into lessons and corresponding datasets for each topic:
- **Lessons with Tasklist**: Learning lessons and after that tasklist which I complete point to point which I complete myself.
- **Supplementary**: Here I put some materials I am learning from apart from the Learnnig Path itself.
- **My Exercises**: Here I update my own exercises, practice and datasets I tried to analyise. Just because I am curious

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m focusing on during this journey:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: pandas, NumPy
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: scikit-learn
  - Statistics: scipy
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Workflow Automation**: Jupyter Notebooks

## **About Me**
Iâ€™m passionate about learning, coding, and exploring how computational tools can solve biological problems. Feel free to explore this repository, and if you have any feedback or suggestions, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
