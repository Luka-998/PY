# Data Science Learning Path - DataKolektiv

Welcome to my **Data Science Learning Path** repository! This project is part of my journey to master data science concepts, improve my Python programming skills, and build a solid foundation for future applications in **bioinformatics** and **data analysis**.

---

## **Goal**:

Share my progress and understanding through well-documented exercises and projects.

---

##  **Repository Structure**
The repository is organized into lessons and corresponding datasets for each topic:
- **Lessons with Tasklist**: Learning lessons and after that tasklist which I complete point to point.
- **Supplementary**: Here I put some materials I am learning from apart from the Learnnig Path itself.
- **My Exercises**: Here I update my own exercises, practice and datasets I tried to analyise. 

 **Libraries used**:
  - Data Manipulation: pandas, NumPy
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: scikit-learn, sklearn
  - Statistics: scipy
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
