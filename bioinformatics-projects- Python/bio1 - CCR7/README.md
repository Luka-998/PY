In this mini-project I have used **Biopython** to fetch and analyze **real DNA sequences** from the **NCBI GenBank** database.  
It includes:
- Fetching genomic sequences from NCBI using **Entrez**
-  **GC-content analysis** 
-  **Translation into protein sequences** 

###  *Example Gene: BRCA1 (Breast Cancer Gene)**
This script retrieves **BRCA1 mRNA** from NCBI and:
- Calculates **GC content**.
- Converts the **DNA sequence into protein**.
- Saves results to a text file.

About BRCA1 Gene:

The BRCA1 gene (Breast Cancer 1) is crucial in the maintenance of genomic stability, specifically in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. It is located on chromosome 17 and encodes a tumor suppressor protein. Mutations in BRCA1 are linked to a higher risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer.

-The gene's mRNA is translated into the BRCA1 protein, which participates in various cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair mechanisms. 

## Applications in Bioinformatics:

- `RNA-seq` data analysis can be employed to examine the expression levels of BRCA1 mRNA in different tissues or under various conditions.

- Variant calling in BRCA1 gene sequence data can help identify pathogenic mutations associated with an increased risk of breast or ovarian cancers.
