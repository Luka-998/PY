"# Sequence Alignment" 

** pairwise sequence alignment **

- `global` alignment

- `local` alignment


## Sequence alignment is used to compare DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to find regions of similarity.

### 1) Global alignment (Algorithm: Needleman-Wunsch):

#### Example use cases:

- Comparing genes of closely related species.

- Checking for evolutionary relationships.

### 2) Local alignment (Algorithm: Smith-Waterman):

#### Best for:

- Finding highly similar regions within large, divergent sequences.

- Identifying conserved domains within different genes.

- Comparing different species' genomes to find functional elements.
