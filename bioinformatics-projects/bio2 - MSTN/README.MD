This  script queries the NCBI Gene database for the myostatin gene using Bio.Entrez, retrieves the first matching gene ID, and then fetches detailed gene information in XML format.

It can be improved by handling multiple results rather than just using the first one.

This is just my experimenting with the module, currently I am learning how to read and transform the JSON format.
